### About this site

This is a client-side web application which communicates with a back-end API server containing a subset of the CompassIoT data tables.

### Data protection and privacy

This site is built using a sample of the CompassIoT data, in aggregate form for data protection. The individual probe vehicle traces are password-protected and the processed data anonymized and only available via an API Key. Contact the project manager to request access.
